[Snowman](https://snowman-mu.vercel.app/) is a composable NFT based on the ERC4883 standard which enables you to mint a snowman with dynamic attributes(sky color, wind direction which affects the snowfall direction, eye focus, e.t.c) and compose with other accessories(Hatüé©, Scarfüß£, e.t.c).

## How it works

### [Video Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6UHlhepcBo)

A user can mint a Snowman for 0.02 ETH. Then mint other accessories(NFTs). If the accessory has been allowed by the Snowman contract owner to be used for composition, the accessory can be transferred using `safeTransferFrom` to the Snowman NFT contract which triggers the `onERC721Received` function which then adds the accessory to the accessory owner's Snowman specified in the `bytes` param of the `safeTransferFrom` function. The `tokenURI` and the `renderTokenById` functions will then return the Snowman with it's accessories. Accessories can be removed by users at any time using the `removeAccessory` or `removeAllAccessories` functions.

`‚úçÔ∏èNote: Users are allowed to create an accessory which will be added to the snowman if suitable... A Christmas TreeüéÑ would be nice, wouldn't it?üôÇ`
